# nyc-taxi-data-analysis
The aim of that project was to analyse the free data set of the NYC taxi commission containing different parameters of interest of a taxi ride. We analysed the dataset with the big data framework "Apache Spark" by firstly preparing the set, extracting different features and in the end illustrating various dependencies of interest.
