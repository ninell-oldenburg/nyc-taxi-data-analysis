# NYC Taxi Commission Data Analysis

The aim of that project was to analyse the free data set of the NYC taxi commission containing different parameters of 
interest of a taxi ride using the big data framework "Apache Spark".

## Background 

The NYC taxi commission openly releases data about all taxi trips since 2009 (see: 
http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). For the final project of the lecture "Big Data and Social 
Networks" by Prof. Yannis Velegrakis at the University of Trento we analysed the mentioned dataset with the big data framework 
"Apache Spark" by firstly preparing the set, extracting different features and in the end illustrating various dependencies of 
interest. The results will be displayed in tables as well as shown in graphs made with R. 

## Use

The code comes in two forms: as Python-File and as Jupyter Notebook. For executing this you need to get a databricks account 
(https://databricks.com/), and import the notebook via the databricks workspace. 

For executing the code via the shell you would need to first install spark (liked discribed here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23256536/importing-pyspark-in-python-shell) and add the import to the code.

## Additions

Feel free to add extra analysis to the code. We also wrote a paper about the project. Text someone of us to get the PDF. 

## Thanks

Thanks to the initiator of the project, Prof. Yannis Velegrakis, who directed to mentioned course at the University of Trento 
in winter semester 2018/2019.
